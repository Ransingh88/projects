## Description:
**Make Healthcare Affordable To Save Lives Today, While Securing Families For A Better Tomorrow.** <br/>

We knew this. Even before the pandemic, we knew that a large number of Indians struggled to pay for critical health costs, that very few had insurance to fight health emergencies, and that one critical illness could deplete the entire family’s financial health, sometimes even burying them in debt for years. More than 50 million Indians have already been pushed into poverty because of healthcare related costs.<br/>

Which is why, in 2014, we launched ImpactGuru to offer a more compassionate solution to those fighting critical illnesses and to empower individuals from around the globe to help those in need.<br/>

Today, we know better. We know that more healthcare financing options need to be accessible to all Indians, that health emergencies arrive more often than we think and we are less prepared than we believe, and that we are all vulnerable regardless of our economic status. Which is why, we are going beyond creating a platform, to building innovations that can help a farmer save his new-born as well as a doctor who can no longer pay for his wife’s cancer treatment.<br/>

This project is clone of **[Impactguru](https://www.impactguru.com/)** website which is a fundraiser website where it Make Healthcare Affordable To Save Lives Today, While Securing Families For A Better Tomorrow.<br/>
We are creating innovative technology and finance solutions to empower Indians to raise funds for medical emergencies and critical illnesses and raise funds for a range of social and personal causes. Our platform has been used by lakhs to change lives through timely contributions, fundraisers and actions.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Clone or Download

* Clone the project to your local system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ransingh88/project-impact_guru.git
```
**or**
* Download the Zip file

## Installation

* **Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install node Module.**

```bash
npm install
```

* **To start the server**
```bash
npm start
```
or

```bash
npm run start
```

* **To start JSON server**
```bash
json-server --watch data.json
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
